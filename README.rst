libmockspotify
**************

A mock of libspotify for use in development of language bindings.

This project was split out of `pyspotify <http://pyspotify.mopidy.com/>`_, so
that it could be reused by the developers of other language bindings for
libspotify, such as the Node.js and Ruby bindings.

Coordination of the development efforts takes place on
`GitHub <https://github.com/mopidy/libmockspotify>`_.

A Debian package of libmockspotify is available from
`Mopidy's APT archive <http://apt.mopidy.com/>`_.
